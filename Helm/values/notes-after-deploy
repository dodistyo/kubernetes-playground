NOTES:
kube-state-metrics is a simple service that listens to the Kubernetes API server and generates metrics about the state of the objects.
The exposed metrics can be found here:
https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/blob/master/docs/README.md#exposed-metrics

The metrics are exported on the HTTP endpoint /metrics on the listening port.
In your case, k8s-state-metrics-kube-state-metrics.monitoring.svc.cluster.local:8080/metrics

They are served either as plaintext or protobuf depending on the Accept header.
They are designed to be consumed either by Prometheus itself or by a scraper that is compatible with scraping a Prometheus client endpoint.
